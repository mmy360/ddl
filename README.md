### This is the package inspired by the open-source libraries such PyTorch Lightning and of course d2l.
### On the wish to have three classes:
### (1)Module contains models, losses and optimization methods;
### (2)DataMoudle provides data loaders for training and validation;
### (3)both classes are combined using the Training class, which allows us to train models on a variety of hardware platforms, cpus and gpus,for example. It also contains optimization algorithms.
